## Overview

This is the Book Mark landing page challenge. This project has five sections with a header and footer. It has a hero section, a feature tab section, a downloard card section, an FAQ section, etc. It is made up of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the newsletter form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

It was a great project that taught me a lot of new things and helped me get better at coding. One of the challenges that I faced was mobile toggle navigation. One more tiny challenge that I faced was that I was really confused about how to add a hover effect to SVG, but after some time I was able to figure it out. Similarly, I also faced other small challenges while making this website. This project also allowed me to practice a lot of CSS and some Javascript. 

### Continued development

My goal is to improve my code and make it more readable, clean, and effective. I would like to improve my bookmark challenge solution's mobile toggle navigation and add a tab section. In addition, I will learn accessibility so that I can make my website accessible.
